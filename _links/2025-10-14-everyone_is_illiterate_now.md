> It really just seems like researchers can’t (or won’t) read carefully anymore. Some authors failed to identify major relevant literature from the proceedings of the very conference they were submitting to. Others simply didn’t bother to add citations to work they described directly and referred to by name. Even some of the other conference reviewers spoke in platitudes rather than point out specific parts of the paper that exemplified the points they were making. (The submissions have line numbers! They are in red!!)
