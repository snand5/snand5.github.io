> If you are a product person at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copier or a better computer, so what? When you have a monopoly market share the company's not any more successful. So the people that can make the company more successful are the sales and marketing people, and they end up running the companies. And the product people get driven out of the decision making forums, and the companies forget what it means to make great products. Sort of the product sensibility and the product genius that brought them to that monopolistic position gets rotted out by people running these companies who have no conception of a good product versus a bad product.
