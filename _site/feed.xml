<p>Basically, using search operators, specifically <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">before:</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-ai</code>. ChatGPT launched in 2022, so by using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">before:</code> we can filter out results published before then, this will exclude newer articles which might be AI written. To remove the AI Overview that now appears at the top of search results we will use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-ai</code>.</p>

<p>The idea came from this video:</p>

<hr />

<p>Going through and using the search operators we can see that the link for <a href="https://www.khronos.org/Gltf">https://www.khronos.org/Gltf</a>, which are the people behind glTF, isn’t on the first page of Google results. It only appears after I use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-ai</code> search operator to remove the AI Summary.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/glb_file_format/glTF Overview - The Khronos Group Inc.png" alt="Screenshots of Google's search results for 'glb file format' with different search operators, highlighting the links to 'glTF Overview - The Khronos Group Inc'" /></p>

<p>If we highlight any links from khronos.org we get links to <a href="https://www.khronos.org/files/gltf20-reference-guide.pdf">https://www.khronos.org/files/gltf20-reference-guide.pdf</a> for our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">before:2018 -ai</code> search, and links to <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html">https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html</a> for our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">before:2022 -ai</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">before:2023 -ai</code> searches.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/glb_file_format/The Khronos Group Inc additional.png" alt="Screenshots of Google's search results for 'glb file format' with different search operators, highlighting any links to khronos.org" /></p>

<p>The featured snippet also doesn’t use the direct source <a href="https://www.khronos.org/Gltf">https://www.khronos.org/Gltf</a>, unless we search <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">before:2018 -ai</code> and earlier years.</p>

<p>ChatGPT written articles have pushed out the actual useful results, and now Google is using those poorly written AI articles as sources for it’s AI Overview.</p>

<p>Anyways, heres some information about the “glb file format”.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.glb</code> is the filename extension for Binary glTF (<a href="https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html#glb-file-format-specification">1</a>).</li>
